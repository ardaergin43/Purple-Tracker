# PurpleTracker

PurpleFocus is a Python-based program designed specifically for users with purple color blindness. It is **not intended for gaming or gaining advantages** over other users. The application detects purple tones on your screen and automatically moves the mouse cursor over them.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- The interface is simple and entirely in English.
- There is a known issue: the **Status display is misaligned** and does not appear properly at the bottom of the window.
- Sound files (`open.mp3` and `close.mp3`) exist in the project but are currently not functional.
- The project can be further developed to fix the Status display and improve UI alignment.

## 🖱️ How It Works
1. Run `main.py` with Python installed on your system.
2. Press the **C key** on your keyboard to activate the program.
3. When active, the mouse cursor will automatically move to and stay over any purple color detected on your screen, with zero delay.
4. If disabled, the mouse will ignore purple colors entirely.

## 📝 Features
- Designed for users with purple color blindness.
- Fast, zero-delay mouse focus on purple colors.
- Lightweight and minimal interface.
- Open for further development, including fixing Status display and enabling sound feedback.
